## Abstract

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science, enabling scientists to
“stand on the shoulders of giants.” Computational research, which is
increasingly pervasive as ever more of science becomes data rich,
faces particular challenges to reproducibility, such as dependency
chains, runtime environment heterogeneity, difficulty of end-to-end
automation and resource demands. Many of these challenges are
technical, and overcoming them therefore inherently involves
technologies, tools and practices that often have little to do with
domain science. Nonetheless, computationally savvy domain scientists
undeterred by the bewildering technology soup have pushed the envelope
in improving the reproducibility of computational research. Yet, in
part because of the technology soup, there are huge opportunities for
campus IT groups and organizations to take an active, leading role in
the intelligent and coordinated development, improvement, deployment
and teaching of these technologies and practices. This panel brings
together faculty, bioinformaticians and IT personnel from across Duke
who are participating in an international collaboration to develop a
reproducible science curriculum, and who are actively prototyping and
developing tools to improve the reproducibility of data and
compute-intensive research. In summary, we hope to position Duke to
become one of the leaders and innovators of reproducible science by
stimulating dialog and collaboration between the research,
computational and IT talents on campus.
